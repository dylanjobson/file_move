# File Mover 

 This is a simple project that moves a specific type of file into a folder. It can be used with any file extension and is perfect for sorting through messy folders! 

## Getting Started 

You will need to have Python installed on your machine to run this code. This project makes use of os, shutil, and glob. All three modules are in the standard library with no additional installation required.  

## Choosing a Path 

You will need to enter your own file path for the source and destination. If you are a MacOS user, a simple way of checking the file path of a folder is to drag and drop that folder into terminal. 

## Choosing an Extension 

You can input any desired extension using the format provided in the code. For example, if you wish to move .mp4 files, type: 
```
extension = '*.mp4'
```
